% This file contains the reference TikZ styles, that ought to be used by all metsymb symbols to ensure a uniform look.
% 
% In other words, TikZ styles should *never* be defined in individual tikzpictures, but here instead, where they can be shared and access by all.
% Doing so should ease the global modification of styles for all symbols at once.
%

\tikzstyle{every picture}=[line width=1.4pt, color=black]

% Should a specific subset of symbol ever require some custom style adjustment (which is likely), they can be defined here as follows:
% \tikzstyle{fancy symbol style}=[line width=2.0pt, color=black, ...]
